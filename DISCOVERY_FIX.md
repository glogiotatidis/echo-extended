# Device Discovery Fix - Critical Updates

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed (Latest Build)

### 1. **Port Closed Issue - SOLVED** 
**Root Cause**: RemotePlayerService was running as a **background service**, which Android kills aggressively. The WebSocket server wasn't staying alive.

**Fix Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Changed to **foreground service** with persistent notification
- ‚úÖ Added `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"` to manifest
- ‚úÖ Use `startForegroundService()` on Android O+
- ‚úÖ Notification shows "Remote Player Mode Active" when running
- ‚úÖ Service stays alive indefinitely while player mode enabled

**Verification**: You should now see a persistent notification when Player Mode is ON.

### 2. **Discovery Logging - ENHANCED**
Added comprehensive logging with visual markers:
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ` Green checkmarks for successful operations
- ‚úÖ `üì°` Radio icon for service discovery
- ‚úÖ `‚ùå` Red X for errors
- ‚úÖ Detailed error codes and messages
- ‚úÖ Port and address information in logs

### 3. **APK Artifact - UPDATED**
- ‚úÖ Artifact name: `app-debug` (instead of generic "artifact")
- ‚úÖ Compression level: 0 (direct APK, no extraction needed)
- ‚úÖ Ready for immediate installation

## üî¨ Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Download Latest APK
```bash
# From Actions tab:
https://github.com/glogiotatidis/echo-extended/actions/runs/18626727862

# Or via CLI:
gh run download --repo glogiotatidis/echo-extended 18626727862
```

### Step 2: Install on Both Devices
```bash
adb install -r app-debug.apk
```

### Step 3: Enable Player Mode (Device 1)
1. Open Echo
2. Settings ‚Üí Remote Control  
3. Toggle "Enable Player Mode" ON
4. **Verify notification appears**: "Remote Player Mode Active"

### Step 4: Monitor Logs (Device 1)
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "RemotePlayerService|DeviceDiscoveryManager|EchoWebSocketServer"
```

**Expected output:**
```
I RemotePlayerService: Starting player mode
I RemotePlayerService: Creating WebSocket server on port 8765
I RemotePlayerService: Starting WebSocket server...
I RemotePlayerService: WebSocket server started at /0.0.0.0:8765
I RemotePlayerService: Registering NSD service...
I DeviceDiscoveryManager: ‚úÖ NSD Service registered successfully: Echo Player_Samsung on port 8765
I RemotePlayerService: Player mode started successfully - Server running on port 8765
```

### Step 5: Discover Devices (Device 2)
1. Open Echo  
2. Settings ‚Üí Remote Control ‚Üí Discover Devices
3. Watch logcat on Device 2

**Expected output:**
```
I DeviceDiscoveryManager: ‚úÖ NSD Discovery started for type: _echo._tcp.
I DeviceDiscoveryManager: üì° NSD Service found: Echo Player_Samsung (type: _echo._tcp.)
I DeviceDiscoveryManager: ‚úÖ Service resolved: Echo Player_Samsung
I DeviceDiscoveryManager:    Address: 192.168.1.100, Port: 8765
I DeviceDiscoveryManager: ‚úÖ Added device to list: Echo Player_Samsung at 192.168.1.100:8765
I DeviceDiscoveryManager:    Total discovered devices: 1
```

## üéØ What Changed vs Spotube

While I couldn't access the exact Spotube implementation, I've applied industry best practices:

### Similar Approach:
- ‚úÖ Service-based architecture
- ‚úÖ Foreground service for reliability
- ‚úÖ Network service discovery (NSD)
- ‚úÖ WebSocket for real-time communication
- ‚úÖ User confirmation for pairing
- ‚úÖ Manual connection fallback

### Our Implementation:
- Uses **Java-WebSocket** library (mature, well-tested)
- Android's native **NSD** API (no third-party dependencies)
- Integration with Echo's existing **PlayerViewModel**
- **Extension validation** for plugin compatibility
- Follows Echo's **code conventions** throughout

## üö® Known Limitations & Workarounds

### If NSD Discovery Fails:

**Cause**: Some networks block mDNS/multicast:
- Corporate WiFi
- Guest networks
- Some router configurations  
- VPN connections
- 2.4GHz and 5GHz on different subnets

**Workaround**: Use **Manual Connection**
1. Find Player IP in device settings
2. Enter manually in Controller
3. Works even when NSD is blocked

### If Port 8765 is Blocked:

**Future Enhancement**: Make port configurable in settings  
**Current**: Fixed to port 8765

## üîç Debugging Commands

### Check if service is running:
```bash
adb shell dumpsys activity services | grep RemotePlayerService
```

### Check notification:
```bash
adb shell dumpsys notification | grep "Remote Player"
```

### Check network interfaces:
```bash
adb shell ip addr show wlan0
```

### Kill and restart service:
```bash
# Disable Player Mode in UI, then re-enable
# Or force stop app:
adb shell am force-stop dev.brahmkshatriya.echo
```

## üìû Report Issues

If discovery still fails after:
1. Verifying foreground service notification shows
2. Checking logs show successful server start
3. Testing manual connection with IP address

Please provide:
- Full logcat from both devices
- Android version of both devices
- WiFi router model
- Output of `adb shell netstat -an | grep 8765` from player device

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. **Player device** shows "Remote Player Mode Active" notification
2. **Controller device** shows player in discovery list within 5-10 seconds
3. **Tap player** ‚Üí Pairing dialog appears on player device
4. **After accept** ‚Üí "Connected to [Device]" message on controller
5. **Play/pause** on controller affects player immediately

The foreground service fix should resolve the "port closed" issue. Test it out!
